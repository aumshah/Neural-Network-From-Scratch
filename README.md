<h1 align="center">Simple-Neural-Network From Scratch in Python</h1>

This is a simple Neural Network created without any Machine Learning Libraries. The only dependencies are the random module for a randomized weight and Matplotlib for visualization. The purpose of this Neural Network is to fit a line to a set of datapoints.

## Known Bugs / Issues

<ul>
  <li>The Neural Network has a somewhat hard time with datasets larger than 20. (This can be fixed by lowering the learning rate)</li>
  <li>The Neural Network does not have a bias yet which means it cannot accurately fit data points with a y intercept.
<ul>
